## iOS 101: Lab - Unit 3 - CloudCast Pt. 1 (Building a Weather App UI)

### ðŸŽ¯ Goals

By the end of this lab I was able to...

1. Build a user interface using Storyboard and Interface Builder
2. Apply AutoLayout constraints to layout UI elements properly
3. Connect UI elements to code using `IBOutlet` and `IBAction`
4. Create and use a data model to drive the UI

### ðŸš€ Features

#### âœ… Required Features

1. Display static UI elements using Interface Builder in `Main.storyboard`
2. Create a `WeatherForecast` data model to represent forecast data
3. Populate the UI using values from the data model
4. Change the forecast when a button is tapped using an `IBAction`
5. Add a gradient background to the app screen
